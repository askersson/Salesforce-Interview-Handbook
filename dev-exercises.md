## 10 Day Dev Challenge

Repetition is a key learning aid because it helps transition a skill from the conscious to the subconscious. Through repetition, a skill is practiced and rehearsed over time and gradually becomes easier. Below are exercises to help make coding a habit. All the exercises are to be done via code, not clicks. 

### Day 1 (Apex: Collections & Inserting Records)
